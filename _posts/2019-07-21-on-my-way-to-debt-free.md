## Throw everything upside down

So right now I am reading a great book that throws basically everything upside down, or so the author says. I grew up a little different, as with most things there is not one way to do something. I wasn't exposed to TV like most millennials nor did I have the latest thing in fashion (nor did I want to). So everything that I have read so far in this book is not so out there as one may be led to believe. I didn't have a credit card until I was in my early 20s, which looking back now after reading a few chapters in the book makes me thankful. I can't imagine where I would be now if I had gotten one earlier. I am thankful that I have not made it further in life just accruing this debt underneath me. That said though I have way too much debt - thank you college.

## When stress takes you over

Last night I had this scary dream where my world was just falling apart due to my stubbornness and insecurities in life. Today I found myself thinking that there is no need to feel the way I do, however there is a certain scary truth to the dream. Say I did lose my job. Yes, I know that I could find another, but what happens in the mean time? I do not have a lot of savings that could hold my family and the bills over until I found that other job. My family would then be dependent on one income. What if my partner then also lost their job? What then?

## Hello it is me, your nightmare

OK, yes it was a dream that got a little out of hand, but I guess it was a wake up call saying hey you need to get your ***t together and figure out where you want to be in the future. I don't want to continue down this path - the path where my dreams are my nightmares and not what I want to develop into.

So today I have decided to get more serious - to take control of expenses. This next month I plan on removing most of my credit cards out of my wallet and experimenting with a fixed budget with goals throughout the whole month. Let's see how well this goes. Say goodbye student loans and credit card bills and hello to an invested and vibrant future! Cross your fingers and come along for the journey as I work to become debt free. Let's do this make over!!

Until next time - check out Dave Ramsey's book - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595555277/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1595555277&linkCode=as2&tag=flyingporg-20&linkId=2cda31d7315bae7ef9cd9fc00aba01b0">The Total Money Makeover: A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness</a>. It is well worth the money, and will get you thinking in a different way. Either that or will start having nightmares like me.

Peace out ~Flying Porg
