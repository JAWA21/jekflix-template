# Hello world!

It may seem cheesy (mmm cheese), but all good blogs about life and tech should start with this post. It is always good to introduce yourself - even if most people will not read this.

> Introduce yourself! Create an indentity and build off it

So, this isn't my first go at creating a blog. Like most developers and creatives I tend to over think or strive to perfection and never really complete anything to my satisfaction. Having said that I don't plan on throughing all cares to the wind, but using this format as more of a documentation of process and way for me to look back at previous work or ideas and easily expound on them.

## Out with the old?
Society these days puts emphasis on new everything. We very much live in a throw away world. In addition to being a front end developer I enjoy fixing things and working with my hands. In the future I plan sharing some techniques that I use to repair or keep older electronics working. Also, if you do decide to upgrade *be sure to safely recycle your electronics* - respect the Earth and take care of it y'all.

## What is to come
Stick around for some interesting articles. Maybe you will find something useful / helpful for your daily life.
* Life
* Tech
* Frameworks
* Food
* Passion for good coffee
